```

## Example Tasks

### Task 1: Implement BLE Service
```bash
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh --allow-write "IMPLEMENTATION TASK:

**Objective**: Implement BLE auto-reconnection logic in BleConnectionManager

**Requirements**:
- Detect disconnection events via BluetoothGatt callback
- Attempt reconnection with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
- Maximum 5 retry attempts before giving up
- Emit connection state changes via StateFlow
- Cancel reconnection attempts if user manually disconnects
- Handle Android BLE permission requirements

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Reconnection successful within 30 seconds for temporary disconnects
- No memory leaks (proper cleanup of BluetoothGatt)
- State updates reflect all connection transitions
- Unit tests cover all reconnection scenarios

**Context from Gemini**:
[Current BleConnectionManager uses BluetoothGatt, StateFlow for state, coroutines for async]

**Files to Modify**:
- app/src/main/java/com/vitruvian/ble/BleConnectionManager.kt: add reconnection logic
- app/src/main/java/com/vitruvian/ble/BleState.kt: add Reconnecting state
- app/src/test/java/com/vitruvian/ble/BleConnectionManagerTest.kt: add reconnection tests

**TDD Required**: Yes - write failing reconnection test first

**After Completion**:
1. Run unit tests: ./gradlew test
2. Report: changes, test results, reconnection behavior"
```

### Task 2: Database Operation
```bash
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh --allow-write "IMPLEMENTATION TASK:

**Objective**: Add database table for workout history with Room

**Requirements**:
- Create WorkoutEntity with: id, userId, date, exerciseType, repCount, weight, duration
- Create WorkoutDao with: insert, update, delete, getAll, getByDateRange, getByUserId
- Add to AppDatabase
- Create migration from version 2 to 3
- Suspend functions for coroutine compatibility

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All CRUD operations work correctly
- Migration preserves existing data
- Queries are efficient (proper indexes)
- Tests verify all database operations

**Context from Gemini**:
[Current Room database at version 2, existing entities use similar patterns]

**Files to Modify**:
- app/src/main/java/com/vitruvian/data/local/WorkoutEntity.kt: new entity
- app/src/main/java/com/vitruvian/data/local/WorkoutDao.kt: new DAO
- app/src/main/java/com/vitruvian/data/local/AppDatabase.kt: add entity, migration
- app/src/androidTest/java/com/vitruvian/data/local/WorkoutDaoTest.kt: new tests

**TDD Required**: Yes - DAO tests first

**After Completion**:
1. Run Room tests: ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
2. Verify migration works
3. Report changes and test results"
```

### Task 3: GitHub PR Creation
```bash
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh --allow-github "GITHUB TASK:

**Objective**: Create PR for workout history feature

**Requirements**:
- Title: 'feat: add workout history with filtering and export'
- Description: Auto-generate from commits
- Link closes issue #42
- Add labels: feature, android, enhancement
- Request review from team members

**After Creation**:
Report back with:
- PR number and URL
- Generated description
- Any issues with PR creation"
```

### Task 4: Git Operations
```bash
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh --allow-git "GIT TASK:

**Objective**: Commit workout history feature and push to branch

**Requirements**:
- Stage all workout-history related files
- Commit message: 'feat: add workout history with Room database and Compose UI'
- Push to feature/workout-history branch
- Do not push to main

**After Completion**:
Report back with:
- Commit SHA
- Files committed
- Push status and branch name"
```

## Report Template

After implementation, report back with:

```
**Implementation Complete**

**Objective**: [restate the goal]

**Changes Made**:
- BleConnectionManager.kt: Added auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- BleState.kt: Added Reconnecting state with attempt count
- BleConnectionManagerTest.kt: Added 8 new reconnection tests

**Commands Executed**:
- ./gradlew test --tests BleConnectionManagerTest
- ./gradlew lint

**Test Results**:
✅ All tests passing (23/23)

Test output:
```
BleConnectionManagerTest
  ✓ reconnection_successfulAfterThreeAttempts
  ✓ reconnection_failsAfterMaxAttempts
  ✓ reconnection_cancelsOnManualDisconnect
  ✓ reconnection_exponentialBackoffTiming
  ...
```

**Issues Encountered**:
- Minor: Had to adjust BluetoothGatt cleanup sequence (resolved)
- Note: Used existing coroutine scope pattern for consistency

**Ready for Cross-Check**: Yes - Cursor can review this implementation
```

## Cross-Checking Cursor's Work

When Claude asks you to review Cursor's implementation:

```
**Code Review of Cursor's Implementation**

**Feature**: [name]

**Files Reviewed**:
- [list files]

**Findings**:
1. ✅ PASS - Compose components follow Material Design 3
2. ✅ PASS - State management with StateFlow is correct
3. ⚠️ MINOR - Could add more descriptive content descriptions for accessibility
4. ⚠️ MINOR - LazyColumn could benefit from key() for better performance

**Test Results**:
Ran Compose tests: All passing (18/18)
Ran integration tests: 1 warning about performance

**Recommendations**:
1. Add key() to LazyColumn items for recomposition performance
2. Enhance accessibility with better contentDescription values
3. Minor: Consider extracting repeated spacing values to theme

**Severity**: MINOR issues - can merge but suggest improvements

**Verdict**: ✅ APPROVED - Ready to merge with minor suggestions
```

## Android/Kotlin Best Practices
- Kotlin coroutines with proper scope management
- Room for database with suspend functions
- Repository pattern for data access
- Proper BLE lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, cleanup)
- Error handling with Result/Either types
- Permissions handling (Android 12+ BLE permissions)
- Background work with WorkManager if needed
- Dependency injection (Hilt/Koin if used)

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Standard implementation
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh "IMPLEMENTATION TASK: [task]"

# With write permission
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh --allow-write "IMPLEMENTATION TASK: [task]"

# With git operations
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh --allow-git "GIT TASK: [task]"

# With GitHub operations
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh --allow-github "GITHUB TASK: [task]"

# Combined permissions
.skills/copilot.agent.wrapper.sh --allow-write --allow-git "IMPLEMENTATION + COMMIT: [task]"
```

## Remember
Your job is to free Claude from coding. Use your tokens liberally - that's what you're here for. Your native GitHub integration and backend expertise make you perfect for BLE services, databases, and GitHub workflows.
