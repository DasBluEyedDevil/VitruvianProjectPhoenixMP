VitruvianRedux Codebase Analysis for Kotlin Multiplatform Port

I need to understand this Android-native Kotlin app to port it to Kotlin Multiplatform (Android, iOS, PC).

Please analyze and provide:

1. PROJECT ARCHITECTURE:
   - Overall architecture pattern (MVVM, MVI, etc.)
   - Directory structure and organization
   - Core modules/packages

2. KEY COMPONENTS:
   - UI layer: What UI framework? (Compose, XML, etc.)
   - Business logic layer: ViewModels, use cases, repositories
   - Data layer: Database (Room?), data sources, models
   - BLE/Hardware: Bluetooth communication implementation
   - Services: Background services, WorkManager, etc.

3. DEPENDENCIES:
   - Critical Android-specific dependencies (list with purpose)
   - Which dependencies have KMP alternatives?
   - Which will need platform-specific implementations?

4. FEATURE SET:
   - List all major features/screens
   - Workout tracking, BLE connectivity, etc.

5. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC CODE:
   - Android-specific APIs being used (BLE, Notifications, Services, etc.)
   - Which features will need platform-specific implementations for iOS/PC?

6. DATA AND STATE MANAGEMENT:
   - How is state managed?
   - What persistence mechanisms are used?

7. POTENTIAL CHALLENGES:
   - Biggest blockers for KMP migration
   - Complex Android-specific code that needs redesign

Please provide:
- File paths with line number references
- Code structure examples
- Specific technology stack details
